+is known as a "VPATH" build.
 
    With a non-GNU `make', it is safer to compile the package for one
 architecture at a time in the source code directory.  After you have
 installed the package for one architecture, use `make distclean' before
 reconfiguring for another architecture.
 
+   On MacOS X 10.5 and later systems, you can create libraries and
+executables that work on multiple system types--known as "fat" or
+"universal" binaries--by specifying multiple `-arch' options to the
+compiler but only a single `-arch' option to the preprocessor.  Like
+this:
+
+     ./configure CC="gcc -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc -arch ppc64" \

+you can set and what kinds of files go in them.  In general, the
+default for these options is expressed in terms of `${prefix}', so that
+specifying just `--prefix' will affect all of the other directory
+specifications that were not explicitly provided.
+
+   The most portable way to affect installation locations is to pass the
+correct locations to `configure'; however, many packages provide one or
+both of the following shortcuts of passing variable assignments to the
+`make install' command line to change installation locations without
+having to reconfigure or recompile.
+
+   The first method involves providing an override variable for each
+affected directory.  For example, `make install
+prefix=/alternate/directory' will choose an alternate location for all
+directory configuration variables that were expressed in terms of
+`${prefix}'.  Any directories that were specified during `configure',
+but not in terms of `${prefix}', must each be overridden at install
+time for the entire installation to be relocated.  The approach of
+makefile variable overrides for each directory variable is required by
+the GNU Coding Standards, and ideally causes no recompilation.
+However, some platforms have known limitations with the semantics of
+shared libraries that end up requiring recompilation when using this
+method, particularly noticeable in packages that use GNU Libtool.
+
+   The second method involves providing the `DESTDIR' variable.  For
+example, `make install DESTDIR=/alternate/directory' will prepend
+`/alternate/directory' before all installation names.  The approach of
+`DESTDIR' overrides is not required by the GNU Coding Standards, and
+does not work on platforms that have drive letters.  On the other hand,
+it does better at avoiding recompilation issues, and works well even
+when some directory options were not specified in terms of `${prefix}'
+at `configure' time.
+
+Optional Features
+=================
 
    If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
 with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
 option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.

+   Some packages offer the ability to configure how verbose the

+--disable-silent-rules' sets the default to verbose, which can be
+overridden with `make V=0'.
+
+Particular systems
+==================
+
+   On HP-UX, the default C compiler is not ANSI C compatible.  If GNU
+CC is not installed, it is recommended to use the following options in
+order to use an ANSI C compiler:
+
+     ./configure CC="cc -Ae -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=500"
+
+and if that doesn't work, install pre-built binaries of GCC for HP-UX.
+
+   HP-UX `make' updates targets which have the same time stamps as
+their prerequisites, which makes it generally unusable when shipped
+generated files such as `configure' are involved.  Use GNU `make'
+instead.
+
+   On OSF/1 a.k.a. Tru64, some versions of the default C compiler cannot
+parse its `<wchar.h>' header file.  The option `-nodtk' can be used as
+a workaround.  If GNU CC is not installed, it is therefore recommended
+to try
+
+     ./configure CC="cc"
+
+and if that doesn't work, try
+
+     ./configure CC="cc -nodtk"
+
+   On Solaris, don't put `/usr/ucb' early in your `PATH'.  This
+directory contains several dysfunctional programs; working variants of
+these programs are available in `/usr/bin'.  So, if you need `/usr/ucb'
+in your `PATH', put it _after_ `/usr/bin'.
+
+   On Haiku, software installed for all users goes in `/boot/common',
+not `/usr/local'.  It is recommended to use the following options:
+
+     ./configure --prefix=/boot/common

-# The reason of the latter failure is that $top_srcdir and $ac_aux_dir

+\`configure' configures libglade 2.6.4 to adapt to many kinds of systems.
+
+Usage: $0 [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...
+
+To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
+VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.
+
+Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.
+
+Configuration:
+  -h, --help              display this help and exit
+      --help=short        display options specific to this package
+      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
+  -V, --version           display version information and exit
+  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking ...' messages
+      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
+  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
+  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
+      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']
+
+Installation directories:
+  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
+                          @<:@@S|@ac_default_prefix@:>@
+  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
+                          @<:@PREFIX@:>@
+
+By default, \`make install' will install all the files in
+\`$ac_default_prefix/bin', \`$ac_default_prefix/lib' etc.  You can specify
+an installation prefix other than \`$ac_default_prefix' using \`--prefix',
+for instance \`--prefix=\$HOME'.
+
+For better control, use the options below.
+

+\`configure' configures libglade 2.6.4 to adapt to many kinds of systems.
+
+Usage: $0 [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...
+
+To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
+VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.
+
+Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.
+
+Configuration:
+  -h, --help              display this help and exit
+      --help=short        display options specific to this package
+      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
+  -V, --version           display version information and exit
+  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking ...' messages
+      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
+  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
+  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
+      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']
+
+Installation directories:
+  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX

+  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
+                          @<:@PREFIX@:>@
+
+By default, \`make install' will install all the files in
+\`$ac_default_prefix/bin', \`$ac_default_prefix/lib' etc.  You can specify
+an installation prefix other than \`$ac_default_prefix' using \`--prefix',
+for instance \`--prefix=\$HOME'.
+
+For better control, use the options below.

+\`configure' configures libglade 2.6.4 to adapt to many kinds of systems.
+
+Usage: $0 [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...
+
+To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
+VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.
+
+Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.
+
+Configuration:
+  -h, --help              display this help and exit
+      --help=short        display options specific to this package
+      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
+  -V, --version           display version information and exit
+  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking ...' messages
+      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
+  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
+  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
+      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']

+  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
+                          @<:@PREFIX@:>@
+
+By default, \`make install' will install all the files in
+\`$ac_default_prefix/bin', \`$ac_default_prefix/lib' etc.  You can specify
+an installation prefix other than \`$ac_default_prefix' using \`--prefix',
+for instance \`--prefix=\$HOME'.
+

+  --with-gnu-ld           assume the C compiler uses GNU ld [default=no]
+  --with-sysroot=DIR Search for dependent libraries within DIR
+                        (or the compiler's sysroot if not specified).
+  --with-html-dir=PATH    path to installed docs
+  --with-xml-catalog=CATALOG
+                          path to xml catalog to use

+  CC          C compiler command
+  CFLAGS      C compiler flags
+  LDFLAGS     linker flags, e.g. -L<lib dir> if you have libraries in a
+              nonstandard directory <lib dir>
+  LIBS        libraries to pass to the linker, e.g. -l<library>
+  CPPFLAGS    (Objective) C/C++ preprocessor flags, e.g. -I<include dir> if

+   - Backslashes not followed by double quotes are not special.
+   - But 2*n+1 backslashes followed by a double quote become
+     n backslashes followed by a double quote (n >= 0):

+# These exist entirely to fool aclocal when bootstrapping libtool.
+#
+# In the past libtool.m4 has provided macros via AC_DEFUN (or AU_DEFUN)
+# which have later been changed to m4_define as they aren't part of the
+# exported API, or moved to Autoconf or Automake where they belong.
+#
+# The trouble is, aclocal is a bit thick.  It'll see the old AC_DEFUN
+# in /usr/share/aclocal/libtool.m4 and remember it, then when it sees us
+# using a macro with the same name in our local m4/libtool.m4 it'll
+# pull the old libtool.m4 in (it doesn't see our shiny new m4_define
+# and doesn't know about Autoconf macros at all.)
+#
+# So we provide this file, which has a silly filename so it's always
+# included after everything else.  This provides aclocal with the
+# AC_DEFUNs it wants, but when m4 processes it, it doesn't do anything
+# because those macros already exist, or will be overwritten later.
+# We use AC_DEFUN over AU_DEFUN for compatibility with aclocal-1.6. 
+#
+# Anytime we withdraw an AC_DEFUN or AU_DEFUN, remember to add it here.
+# Yes, that means every name once taken will need to remain here until
+# we give up compatibility with versions before 1.7, at which point
+# we need to keep only those names which we still refer to.
